abstract: Artificial upwelling (AU) is widely recognized as a geoengineering tool to enhance oceanic fertility and stimulate the earthâ€™s capability of self-healing. Several air-lifted AU systems have been established to promote seaweed growth and facilitate carbon sequestration, for instance, in Norway and China. However, few researchers have addressed the critical issue of optimizing the layout of the underwater nozzle array (UNA), a key component of the air-lifted AU system. In this paper, we propose a novel method to optimize the layout of UNA by introducing and improving the discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm to guide the optimal nozzle positions. Furthermore, we develop the nutrient transport efficiency model to evaluate the performance of the AU system and apply it to investigate a typical AU system, namely the one in Aoshan Bay, China. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DPSO algorithm outperforms the conventional particle swarm optimization algorithm and the nutrient transport efficiency under the optimized UNA layouts was improved by an average of 14.5% to 35.0% compared to randomly generated layouts. These findings suggest that our optimization method could serve as a scientific reference for the engineering design of AU. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The potential of artificial upwelling (AU) in stimulating seaweed growth, consequently enhancing ocean carbon sequestration has been gaining increasing attention in recent years. This has led to the development of the first solar-powered and air-lifted AU system (AUS) in China. However, efficient scheduling of air injection systems in complex marine environments remains a crucial challenge in operating AUS, as it holds the potential to significantly improve system performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel energy management approach that utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to develop efficient strategies for operating AUS. Specifically, we formulate the problem of maximizing energy efficiency of AUS as a Markov decision process and integrate the quantile network in distributional reinforcement learning (QR-DQN) with the deep dueling network to solve it. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its superior effectiveness over traditional rule-based approaches and other DRL algorithms in reducing energy wastage while ensuring the stable and efficient operation of AUS. Our findings suggest that a DRL-based approach offers a promising way to improve the energy efficiency of AUS and enhance the sustainability of seaweed cultivation and carbon sequestration in the ocean.
