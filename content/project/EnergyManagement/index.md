- Efficient scheduling of the air injection system and energy storage system of artificial upwelling system (AUS) in complex marine environments remains a crucial challenge in operating AUS, as it holds the potential to significantly improve system performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel energy management approach that utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to develop efficient strategies for operating AUS. Specifically, we formulate the problem of maximizing energy efficiency of AUS as a Markov decision process and integrate the quantile network in distributional reinforcement learning (QR-DQN) with the deep dueling network to solve it.
- Highlights:
  -  Developed a _DRL-based algorithm_ to optimize energy management strategy under uncertain environmental conditions while ensuring system safety and maximizing efficiency.
  -  Combined **_deep quantile networks_** with **_deep dueling network architectures_** to improve convergence speed and robustness of the DRL method.
  -  Conducted extensive simulation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution and provided insightful analytical results for system operation.
  -  Demonstrated proficiency in programming languages commonly used in DRL, such as _Python and Pytorch_.
  -  Collaborated with a team of researchers and worked independently to _design experiments, analyze data, and develop solutions_.
