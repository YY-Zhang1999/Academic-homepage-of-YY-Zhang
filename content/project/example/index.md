In this work, we have presented a novel approach using the DPSO algorithm to optimize the UNA layout in aquaculture farms, aiming to maximize the NTE of the air-lifted AU system. 
Through simulation experiments conducted in the case of Aoshan Bay, China, our proposed method has been demonstrated to significantly improve the NTE as compared to randomly generated layouts. The suitability of the original layout in Aoshan Bay for certain conditions has also been validated. Moreover, our findings suggest that increasing the number of nozzles is a more effective means of improving the system's capability, albeit at a higher investment cost. Our work highlights the potential of intelligent optimization algorithms in improving the performance of the air-lifted AU system by optimizing UNA layouts under multiple constraints. It is worth noting that our method can be applied in other fields with similar characteristics and conditions, such as water delivery, aeration, and oxygenation, with appropriate fitness functions. 
Overall, our findings can provide practical insights for optimizing the design and operation of air-lifted AU systems to improve their nutrient transport efficiency, which is crucial for addressing issues related to reducing the accumulation of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. To minimize the uncertain impact of AU on the disturbance of the upper and lower ocean ecosystems, further research is necessary to refine the NTE model by considering additional variables and intelligent energy management strategies while accounting for energy and investment cost limitations.
