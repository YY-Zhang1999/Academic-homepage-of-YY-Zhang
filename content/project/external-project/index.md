- We propose a novel data-driven approach to energy management, utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop efficient strategies for operating AUS. 
- Highlights:
  -  Developed a DRL-based algorithm to optimize energy management strategy under uncertain environmental conditions while ensuring system safety and maximizing efficiency.
  -  Combined deep quantile networks with deep dueling network architectures to improve convergence speed and robustness of the DRL method.
  -  Conducted extensive simulation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution and provided insightful analytical results for system operation.
  -  Demonstrated proficiency in programming languages commonly used in DRL, such as Python and Pytorch.
  -  Collaborated with a team of researchers and worked independently to design experiments, analyze data, and develop solutions.
