- In this study, we proposed a novel data-driven approach to **energy management** of the artificial upwelling system, utilizing **deep reinforcement learning (DRL)** to develop efficient strategies for operating AUS. 

- Highlights:
  -  Developed a _DRL-based algorithm_ to optimize energy management strategy under uncertain environmental conditions while ensuring system safety and maximizing efficiency.
  -  Combined **_deep quantile networks_** with **_deep dueling network architectures_** to improve convergence speed and robustness of the DRL method.
  -  Conducted extensive simulation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution and provided insightful analytical results for system operation.
  -  Demonstrated proficiency in programming languages commonly used in DRL, such as _Python and Pytorch_.
  -  Collaborated with a team of researchers and worked independently to _design experiments, analyze data, and develop solutions_.
